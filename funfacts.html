      <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
		  <h2>Viking Ties</h2>
      <p>Iceland was settled by Vikings from Norway sometime in the 800s. This fact makes Iceland a fairly “young” country when it comes to settlement, and also contributes to its distinct cultural background. The Icelandic horses in the country today are unique in the fact that they are direct descendants from the horses the Vikings first brought over from mainland Europe.</p>
		  <h2>First Parliament</h2>
      <p>celand is home to the very first parliament grounds in Europe. In the year 930 AD, the first Parliament met in Iceland in what is today Þingvellir National Park. The site has since been dubbed a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its cultural, historical, and geographical significance.</p>
		  <h2>No Forests</h2>
      <p>Iceland was formed by some pretty harsh phenomena: volcanoes and glaciers. Much of the country was carved out by slow-moving glaciers, chewing up the land and gouging deep valleys into it. But, contrary to popular belief, trees DO grow in Iceland. However, when the Vikings arrived, they forested the crap out of it, cutting down almost all the native tress in the country. Today, reforestation is being attempted, but you'll still definitely notice the lack of forests when you visit. </p>
		  <h2>Elves and Trolls</h2>
      <p>The majority of present-day Icelanders (more than 50%, I was told) believe in the existence of fantastical beings such as elves and trolls. There are many amusing stories and legends about these creatures, and Icelanders go so far as to postpone construction projects if it's believed that something is going to be built where elves currently live. Large fallen rocks in fields are said to be frozen trolls, and one guide told us that the smell present in Iceland isn't from sulphur at all — it's the smell of the trolls' dirty bath water. </p>
		  <h2>Weird Foods</h2>
      <p>Iceland makes up for its lack of fast food with its bevy of downright weird traditional foods. Along with things like whale, puffin, and dried fish, visitors can also try fermented shark, sheep's head, and even pickled ram's testicles. The even weirder part is that some of these dishes can be found in just about ANY kind of restaurant in Iceland</p>
		  <h2>Very little crime</h2>
		  <p>There is little crime in Iceland, and virtually no violent crime. The country does not have a standing army, and its police officers do not carry guns.</p>
		  <h2>Northern Lights and Midnight Sun </h2>
		  <p>Being located very close to the Arctic Circle, Iceland experiences long winter nights and long summer days, with almost 24 hours of darkness/twilight in December and nearly 24 hours of daylight in June. Because of this, Iceland is a great place to see both the Northern Lights and experience the Midnight Sun. Though, both of these can be made difficult to see thanks to Iceland's ever-changing weather.</p>
