      <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
		  <h2>Viking Ties</h2>
      <p>Iceland was settled by Vikings from Norway sometime in the 800s. This fact makes Iceland a fairly “young” country when it comes to settlement, and also contributes to its distinct cultural background. The Icelandic horses in the country today are unique in the fact that they are direct descendants from the horses the Vikings first brought over from mainland Europe.</p>
		  <h2>First Parliament</h2>
      <p>celand is home to the very first parliament grounds in Europe. In the year 930 AD, the first Parliament met in Iceland in what is today Þingvellir National Park. The site has since been dubbed a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its cultural, historical, and geographical significance.</p>
		  <h2>No Forests</h2>
      <p>Iceland was formed by some pretty harsh phenomena: volcanoes and glaciers. Much of the country was carved out by slow-moving glaciers, chewing up the land and gouging deep valleys into it. But, contrary to popular belief, trees DO grow in Iceland. However, when the Vikings arrived, they forested the crap out of it, cutting down almost all the native tress in the country. Today, reforestation is being attempted, but you'll still definitely notice the lack of forests when you visit. </p>
		  <h2>Elves and Trolls</h2>
      <p>The majority of present-day Icelanders (more than 50%, I was told) believe in the existence of fantastical beings such as elves and trolls. There are many amusing stories and legends about these creatures, and Icelanders go so far as to postpone construction projects if it's believed that something is going to be built where elves currently live. Large fallen rocks in fields are said to be frozen trolls, and one guide told us that the smell present in Iceland isn't from sulphur at all — it's the smell of the trolls' dirty bath water. </p>
		  <h2>Weird Foods</h2>
      <p>Fish, lamb and dairy products are the basics of the Icelandic diet. Icelandic fish such as cod, haddock, halibut, ray, redfish, and lobster are caught in the unpolluted waters of the North Atlantic, and has a reputation for superb quality. Freshwater salmon and trout are also popular during the summer months. The use of hormones in livestock is forbidden in Iceland and sheep and lambs roam freely on the mountain meadows during summer. Icelandic dairy produce has a delicate flavor produced by the clean environment and fragrant pastures herds are reared on. Try some of the Icelandic specialties such as skyr, a skimmed milk curd. The Icelandic tap water is natural spring water and is pure and safe to drink throughout the country </p>
