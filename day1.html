              <p>The novel follows a non-linear narrative structure, beginning at a point approximately midway through the overall plot. The narrative switches among multiple viewpoint characters and uses both third- and first-person narrative (the latter in the form of Dr. Goodsir's diary entries).</p>
              <p>The story begins in the winter of 1847. For more than a year, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus have been trapped in ice, 28 miles north-northwest of King William Island. The weather has been much colder than normal, the ships' tinned provisions are dwindling and often putrid, and the sea ice and landmasses are mysteriously devoid of any wildlife that can be hunted. In addition to the natural dangers, the crews are being stalked and attacked by a monster resembling an immense polar bear.</p>
              <p>In flashbacks, the novel relates some of the backstory behind the expedition's current predicament. The Franklin expedition is the latest in a series of attempts to forge the Northwest Passage, all of which have ended in failure. Sir John Franklin, having been recalled in disgrace from a government posting in Van Diemen's Land, views the expedition as his last chance for glory and recognition. Captain Francis Crozier, embittered by romantic rejection at the hands of Franklin's niece, seeks to distract himself by again venturing into the Arctic. The rest of the crew have signed on for adventure. Although the expedition begins auspiciously enough, three men die of disease during their first winter in the ice, and soon afterward, Franklin makes the fateful decision to travel around the northeast coast of King William Island, which results in the ships' becoming trapped.</p>

              <p>In the summer of 1847, Franklin sends out parties in various directions across the ice, in hopes of finding open water. None of the parties succeeds in this goal. However, one of the parties encounters a pair of &quot;Esquimaux&quot; on the ice, a young woman and an old man. They accidentally shoot the man, whereupon they are set upon by the monster, who kills Lt. Graham Gore, the leader of the party. When the party returns to the ships, the girl follows them. Crozier names her &quot;Lady Silence&quot;, as her tongue appears to have been bitten off in the past, rendering her mute. After the Esquimaux man dies aboard Erebus, the monster begins stalking and attacking the crews. Although the beast shows signs of intelligence, the men believe it is nothing more than an unusually aggressive bear. This assumption leads them to underestimate the creature. Franklin is killed in a botched attempt to bait the creature out in the open, and a number of other officers and men are killed as the months progress.</p>
              <p>Following Franklin's death, Crozier becomes the expedition commander, with Captain James Fitzjames assuming the role of executive officer. Despite some initial tension between them, the two men gradually become friends as they attempt to deal with the threats of the monster, disease, and impending starvation. By 1848, the crews become further debilitated by the extreme cold and lack of fresh food, and the monster continues to prey on them. An ill-fated ‘morale boosting’ New Year's Eve carnivale masque ends with a large number of the expedition, including three of the four surgeons, being killed by the monster and friendly fire from the expedition's Royal Marines detachment. Crozier subsequently punishes Caulker’s Mate Cornelius Hickey and two other men with 50 lashes of the cat o' nine tails. Hickey begins to plot against the officers, especially Crozier and Lt. John Irving, who had earlier discovered Hickey copulating with another member of the crew in Terror's hold.</p>
