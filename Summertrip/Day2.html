      <h2>Euro-Asia Plate</h2>

        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/tectonicplates.jpg" width="900" height="1200" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
          <p>The next day, our first trip outside the city started with a stop at the Thingvellir National Park. </p>
          <p>Thingvellir is notable for its unusual tectonic and volcanic environment in a rift valley. The continental drift can clearly be seen in the cracks or faults which traverse the region. At the park center you can learn more about Thingvellir’s geology. At Almannagja, one of these faults on the west side of the plain, you can see the easternmost edge of the North American tectonic plate. It is normally submerged in the Atlantic Ocean. On the east side at the Heidargja Gorge, you are at the westernmost edge of the Eurasian plate.</p>
          <p>Thingvellir is a favourite stop among travellers along the Golden Circle route. It has been a National Park in Iceland since 1930 and was named a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2004. When Viking settlers arrived in the 10th century it was the site they chose as the meeting place of Althingi, the world’s oldest parliament.</p>
          <p>Aside from its historic interest, Thingvellir holds a special appeal for nature lovers. It is the visible site of the mid-Atlantic Ridge where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. The plates are being pulled apart at a rate of 2 centimetres (nearly an inch) per year, creating the Thingvellir Rift Valley. The geology here is not only interesting to learn about but also spectacular to behold.</p>

      <h2>Gullfoss Waterfall</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/gulfosswaterfall.JPG" width="1088" height="1218" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
          <p>Our second stop was the breathataking waterfall Gullfoss. It truly looked much more beautiful than in all the photos and videos I watched. </p>
          <p> Gullfoss Waterfall is a part of the famous Golden Circle Route in Iceland. You will find the waterfall is in the Haukadalur Valley, in the river Hvita (e. White River), along with Geysir. Since Gullfoss is one of Iceland‘s most popular waterfall the route is well marked. Its distance from Reykjavik is about 113km (70 miles) from Reykjavik. From Reykjavik, you need to follow the ring road east for about 54km (33 miles), then turn for route 35. Follow that route until you reach a big parking lot next to a visitor centre.</p>
          <p>Gullfoss is one of the most popular tourist attraction in Iceland and part of the Golden Circle. The waterfall is by many considered one of the most beautiful waterfall in Iceland. You can find the waterfall in the upper part of the Hvita river. </p>
          <p>Gullfoss is also a popular photostop during winter, since it offers a great setting for a beautiful photo of the majestic Northern Lights as they dance across the sky. Gullfoss has also been the location for some films and even music video, as it features in the music video “Heaven” by the American rock band Live. You can see both the waterfall and the 32 meter deep crevice that the river plunges into.</p>

      <h2>Strokkur</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/strokkur.JPG" width="1088" height="1218" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
          <p>Strokkur is Iceland’s most visited active geyser. One of the three major attractions on the world-famous Golden Circle sightseeing route, it is usually visited alongside Gullfoss Waterfall and Þingvellir National Park.</p>
          <p>Strokkur is found in the Geysir Geothermal Area, titled after the Great Geysir, which lent its name to all others across the world. It is the greatest active geyser on site; Geysir itself is in a period of inactivity. Strokkur erupts more regularly than Geysir ever did, blasting water to heights of around fifteen to twenty metres every five to ten minutes, although it is known to reach up to forty metres. </p>
          <p>Active geysers like Strokkur are rare around the world, due to the fact that many conditions must be met for them to form. They are thus only found in certain parts of highly geothermal areas.</p>
          <p>The first condition that is necessary is an intense heat source; magma must be close enough to the surface of the earth for the rocks to be hot enough to boil water. Considering that Iceland is located on top of the rift valley between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, this condition is met throughout most of the county.</p>
