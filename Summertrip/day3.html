      <h1>South of Iceland</h1>
      <h3>August 8, 2018</h3>
      <h2>Skogafoss</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/skofagoss.JPG" width="751" height="947" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
          <p>Skogafoss is a waterfall in the south of Iceland at the cliffs of the former coastline. After the coastline had receded seaward (it is now at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) from Skogar village), the former sea cliffs remained. Skogafoss is unique because the waterfall comes directly from two glaciers, Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull.</p>
          <p>If you climb the 370 steps to the top of Skogafoss waterfall you’ll be rewarded with an awe-inspiring view out over south Iceland’s coastline. This is also the start of the Fimmvorduhals pass, a popular hiking route. Standing at 60 meters (197 ft) tall, the heavy veil of water is impressive and walking close enough envelops visitors in a cloud of spray, sound and refracted light. Due to the amount of spray the waterfall consistently produces, a single or double rainbow is normally visible on sunny days. </p>
          <p>According to legend, a Viking named Thrasi hid his hoarded gold under the falls. Many have tried to find the chest of gold and, as the story goes, a young man almost succeeded. He tied a rope to the chest handle ring and pulled. He only retrieved the ring and returned with it. The ring was later used for the church door at Skogar. The river below the falls holds a large salmon and char population. Don’t be surprise to see fisherman fishing in the river from July – October.</p>

      <h2>Solheimajokull</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/solheimajokull.jpg" width="473" height="545" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
          <p>Sólheimajökull is an outlet glacier of the mighty icecap of Mýrdalsjökull on the South Coast of Iceland. It is one of the most easily accessible glaciers to reach from Reykjavík, just 158 kilometres (98 miles) away.</p>
          <p>About eight kilometres long and two kilometres wide (five miles long and just over a mile wide), Sólheimajökull is an impressive feature. Due to the way it descends from Mýrdalsjökull, however, without a clear distinction between the two, it appears much bigger. Mýrdalsjökull itself has many other outlet glaciers; overall, it is the fourth largest ice cap in Iceland. Beneath its thick surface is one of the country’s most infamous volcanoes, Katla. </p>
          <p>Sadly, like all the glaciers in Iceland bar one, Sólheimajökull is shrinking rapidly. A glacier lagoon at its base reveals how quickly it is receding: the length of an Olympic swimming pool every year. It seems like this change is already an irreversible consequence of climate change, and it may be gone within decades.</p>

      <h2>Reynisfjara</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/blacksandbeach.JPG" width="1088" height="1218" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
			 <p>Reynisfjara is a world-famous black-sand beach found on the South Coast of Iceland, just beside the small fishing village of Vík í Mýrdal.</p>
          <p>With its enormous basalt stacks, roaring Atlantic waves and stunning panoramas, Reynisfjara is widely considered to be the most beautiful example of Iceland’s black sand beaches. In 1991, National Geographic voted Reynisfjara as one of the Top 10 non-tropical beaches to visit on the planet. </p>
          <p>Upon visiting the beach, travelers will immediately observe rocky sea stacks sitting off the shoreline, known as Reynisdrangar.</p>

      <h2>Seljalandfoss</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/seljalandfoss.JPG" width="1088" height="1218" alt="" class="img-fluid"/> </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
			<p>Seljalandsfoss waterfall is a supremely graceful waterfall located in the South Coast of Iceland. This spectacular natural wonder drops around 60 meters into the otherwise tranquil pool below and a hidden path leads you behind the waterfall so you can view the fall from a complete 360° angle.</p>
          <p>When visiting you should be prepared to get a little wet because Seljalandsfoss is one of the very rare waterfalls, anywhere in the world, where it is possible to walk behind the narrow, cascading falls. Following the pathway from the base of the cliff will take you behind the vigorously tumbling waterfall. We recommend you take your time and make the most of an opportunity to take some totally unique photographs. </p>
          <p>Seljalandsfoss is on the Seljalands River which flows all the way down from the famous stratovolcano, Eyjafjallajökull.</p>
          <p>Don’t visit Seljalandsfoss without a stop at Gljúfrabúi waterfall located only a little further West about 200 meters. Those together make up a magical duo, not to be missed! Seljalandsfoss is a popular place so during the midnight sun you might want to consider visiting early or late to beat the crowds.</p>
